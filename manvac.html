                    <p>Back to Earth is a family owned enterprise having begun as a small home-based workshop back in 1997, in the beautiful tropical island of Sri Lanka.
                      Our philosophy is to produce eco-friendly products that have the minimum impact on the environment. We therefore keep exploring new ways of making use of natural discards, up-cycled wood and recycled handmade paper.
                      We have a skilled team working on the production of our wide range of handmade paper items while we also work with rural craftspersons who create the unique handmade wooden product range. We are proud to work with this extended family who are dedicated to making each individual product special and functional.
